## Trading Algorithm

The Gold Digger EA MT5 utilizes a scalping technique to trade gold. The scalping technique code is implemented in the `OnTick()` function. This function is called on every price tick and is where the main trading logic is executed.

The trading logic code is implemented in the `OnStart()` function. This function is called when the EA is started and is responsible for executing the trading strategy. It can include indicators, technical analysis, and other trading rules specific to the gold scalping strategy.

The `OnDeinit()` function is used for cleanup code. It is called when the EA is removed or disabled and can be used to release resources and perform any necessary cleanup tasks.
